# GitHub Actions Self-Healing Deployment System

This directory contains a comprehensive GitHub Actions monitoring and auto-fix system designed to create a self-healing deployment pipeline for the oil-painting-app project.

## System Overview

The system consists of several interconnected workflows that work together to:
- Monitor deployments continuously
- Automatically fix common issues
- Manage dependencies securely
- Maintain deployment quality

## Workflow Files

### 1. `deploy-to-firebase.yml` - Main Deployment Pipeline
The primary deployment workflow with comprehensive pre-deployment checks:

**Triggers:**
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests
- Manual dispatch

**Features:**
- Pre-deployment validation (environment variables, security, build)
- Security audit with npm audit
- Code quality checks (TypeScript, ESLint)
- Comprehensive test suite
- Build verification
- Post-deployment health checks
- Automatic rollback on failure

### 2. `deployment-monitor.yml` - Deployment Monitoring
Monitors deployment status and triggers auto-fix when needed:

**Triggers:**
- Main branch updates
- Deployment workflow completion
- Scheduled health checks (every 4 hours)

**Features:**
- Pre-deployment health checks
- Real-time deployment monitoring
- Error log capture and analysis
- Automatic trigger of auto-fix workflow
- Performance metrics collection
- Notification system

### 3. `auto-fix-deployment.yml` - Automatic Issue Resolution
Automatically fixes common deployment issues:

**Triggers:**
- Failed deployment workflows
- Manual dispatch

**Capabilities:**
- Security vulnerability fixes (npm audit fix)
- Dependency updates (patch/minor versions)
- Build issue resolution
- TypeScript error detection
- Creates PRs with fixes instead of direct commits
- Comprehensive testing after fixes

### 4. `auto-merge-dependabot.yml` - Dependency Management
Automatically merges safe Dependabot PRs:

**Features:**
- Auto-approval of security updates
- Auto-merge of patch and minor updates
- Manual review requirement for major updates
- Intelligent merge strategy selection
- Comprehensive labeling system

### 5. `reusable-deployment-steps.yml` - Shared Components
Reusable workflow with common deployment steps:

**Provides:**
- Standardized setup and validation
- Security audit procedures
- Code quality checks
- Test execution
- Build processes
- Deployment procedures
- Post-deployment verification

### 6. `dependabot.yml` - Dependency Update Configuration
Configures automatic dependency updates:

**Schedule:**
- NPM packages: Weekly (Mondays)
- GitHub Actions: Weekly (Tuesdays)
- Docker: Weekly (Wednesdays)

**Groups:**
- Security updates (immediate)
- Major updates (manual review)
- Minor and patch updates (auto-merge eligible)

## How the System Works Together

### 1. Normal Deployment Flow
```
Push to main → Pre-deployment checks → Tests → Build → Deploy → Post-deployment verification
                ↓ (if issues found)
             Monitor detects issues → Triggers auto-fix → Creates PR with fixes
```

### 2. Dependency Management Flow
```
Dependabot creates PR → Auto-merge workflow evaluates → 
  ├─ Safe updates: Auto-approve and merge
  └─ Major updates: Request manual review
```

### 3. Self-Healing Process
```
Deployment fails → Monitor captures failure → Auto-fix analyzes issue →
  ├─ Security issues: Run npm audit fix
  ├─ Build issues: Clean and rebuild
  ├─ Dependency issues: Update safely
  └─ Create PR with fixes for review
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Repository Secrets
```
FIREBASE_TOKEN          # Firebase deployment token
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID     # Firebase project ID
NEXTAUTH_SECRET        # NextAuth secret key
NEXTAUTH_URL          # NextAuth URL
```

### Repository Settings
1. Enable Actions permissions for repository
2. Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests
3. Enable Dependabot security updates
4. Configure branch protection rules for main branch

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Artifacts Generated
- **Security Audit Results**: Vulnerability scan results (30 days retention)
- **Test Results**: Test execution reports (14 days retention)
- **Build Artifacts**: Deployment-ready builds (7 days retention)
- **Deployment Metrics**: Performance and status data (90 days retention)
- **Error Reports**: Detailed failure analysis (30 days retention)

### Notification Points
The system logs all activities and can be extended with:
- Slack webhook notifications
- Email alerts for critical failures
- Discord webhook integration
- PagerDuty for urgent issues
- Team dashboard updates

## Security Features

### Code Scanning
- Hardcoded secret detection
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Dependency audit automation
- TypeScript safety validation

### Access Control
- PR-based changes (no direct commits to main)
- Required status checks
- Manual review for major changes
- Automated approval only for safe updates

### Data Protection
- Secure secret management
- Environment variable validation
- Build artifact security
- Deployment verification

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Review auto-fix PR quality monthly
2. Update workflow Node.js versions quarterly
3. Review and update security patterns
4. Monitor deployment metrics trends
5. Update notification configurations

### Troubleshooting

#### Auto-fix Not Triggering
1. Check workflow permissions
2. Verify webhook configurations
3. Review workflow trigger conditions
4. Check repository settings

#### False Security Alerts
1. Update security scan patterns
2. Add exceptions to .gitignore patterns
3. Review npm audit configuration
4. Update vulnerable dependency manually

#### Build Failures
1. Check Node.js version compatibility
2. Verify environment variable configuration
3. Review dependency compatibility
4. Check Firebase project settings

## Extending the System

### Adding New Checks
1. Add new job to `reusable-deployment-steps.yml`
2. Update `deploy-to-firebase.yml` to use new check
3. Add corresponding auto-fix logic in `auto-fix-deployment.yml`

### Custom Notifications
1. Add webhook configuration to secrets
2. Update notification steps in monitoring workflow
3. Create custom notification templates

### Additional Environments
1. Update Firebase configuration
2. Add environment-specific secrets
3. Update deployment workflow conditions
4. Configure environment protection rules

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always test locally before pushing
2. Keep dependencies updated regularly
3. Write comprehensive tests
4. Use semantic commit messages
5. Review auto-generated PRs promptly

### For Operations
1. Monitor workflow execution regularly
2. Keep secrets updated and secure
3. Review auto-fix quality monthly
4. Maintain backup deployment procedures
5. Document custom configurations
